Wargame 1: KRYPTON (OverTheWire)

1. Learning Objective
•	Understand basic encryption and decryption techniques.
•	Practice Linux file handling and permission management.
•	Learn to work with symbolic links and ROT cipher.

2. Key Tools/Commands Used
•	ssh
•	echo | base64 --decode
•	cat, tr
•	ln -s
•	chmod
•	mktemp
•	ls, cd, logout

3. Concepts Learned
•	Base64 decoding
•	ROT13/ROT-n Cipher
•	Symbolic linking and permission bypass
•	Frequency analysis for ciphertext
•	Manual decryption with substitution ciphers

4. Walkthrough (Level by Level)
Krypton Level 0 → Level 1
•	Command:
echo S1JZUFRPTklTR1JFQVQ= | base64 --decode
•	Result: KRYPTONISGREAT
•	SSH Login:
ssh -p 2231 krypton1@krypton.labs.overthewire.org

Krypton Level 1 → Level 2
•	Commands:
cd /krypton/krypton1
cat README
cat krypton2 | tr "[A-Z]" "[N-ZA-M]" (ROT13 decryption)
•	Password Found: ROTTEN

Krypton Level 2 → Level 3
•	SSH Login:
ssh -p 2231 krypton2@krypton.labs.overthewire.org
•	Process: Create temp dir → Link keyfile.dat → Run encrypt binary → Decrypt using ROT-N shift manually.
•	Password Found: CAESARISEASY

Krypton Level 3 → Level 4
•	Commands:
Frequency analysis using tr and wc commands.
•	Substitution Cipher: Decoded using letter frequency comparison.
•	Password Found: BRUTE

Krypton Level 4 → Level 5
•	Commands:
Explore /krypton/krypton4, find clues inside found1, krypton5.
•	Password Found: CLEARTEXT

Krypton Level 5 → Level 6
•	Commands:
Similar file access patterns, exploration.
•	Password Found: RANDOM

Krypton Level 6 → Level 7
•	Process:
Work with files inside /krypton/krypton6, link files, use encrypt6 binary and xxd tool for bit-level analysis.

5. Reflection/Notes
•	Focused heavily on understanding simple ciphers and Linux file structure.
•	Using symbolic links smartly helped to bypass permission restrictions.
•	Manual decryption was slow but improved logical thinking on ciphers.
