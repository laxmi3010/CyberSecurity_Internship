Leviathan Over the Wire
 

This is all the details we have for the Leviathan Over the wire game. So let’s connect to it and then find the answers or you can say passwords for the next Levels. Now make the connection using the ssh

Level0:-
 
Pass: leviathan0
Command:- ls- al
 

Now let’s find what’s inside the .backup folder
 

Here we have the bookmarks.html file lets go through it if we have the password for the next level. Here we know that the next level user is leviathan1 then let’s find the keyword in the html file for that

 
And here we got the password 3QJ3TgzHDq

Level1:-
 

Pass: 3QJ3TgzHDq

 

Here we found that we have an executable file named as check so let’s try to run it 
 

As we don;t know the password let’s try to check the libraries and other things this program is using by using the tool ltrace
 

We saw that the code is comparing using the strmcp function so let’s try that string we have in the code 
 

After the pass that we have we got the connection to the leviathan2 and we got the password for the leviathan2 in the file located at /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2 and the pass is NsN1HwFoyN

Level2:-
ssh leviathan2@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
 

Pass: NsN1HwFoyN

 
Here we see that we have an executable file named as printfile so let’s try to run that file 

 
As we have to provide a file name let’s provide it with the /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 as  have the password in that file 

 
We can’t access that file but let’s try to analyse the program and test it with some test file 

 
We use l trace and see that the program is using the access() function to using “/bin/cat” to read the contents of the file we previously saw that the program is owned by leviathan3 so lets try to make a file with touch (touch pass\ file.txt) this will create a file as “pass file.txt” and then try to run that printfile program on that. As we can see in the image below that the program is treating it as two different files so let’s create a symbolic link to the file pass as the program will be running with the privileges of the leviathan3.
Ln -s /etc/leviaathan_pass/leviathan3

 
And after running that with the command: ~/./printfile “pass file.txt” we got the password

 
Pass: f0n8h2iWLP
LEVEL3-

ssh leviathan3@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
 
Pass: f0n8h2iWLP
 
Here after listing the files and folders in the working directory we see that there is an executable file named level3 so i just tries to run that and it prompts for a password so i just provide it with 1 and get that it is the wrong password so let’s try to use our tool ltarce on the program

 
Then i see that there is a function strcmp() which compare our pass with the snlprintf so i just tried to run the program again and give it the password snlprintf

 
And we got the shell here and then we just got the password from the /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan4 and the pass is WG1egElCvO



 
LEVEL4:-
ssh leviathan4@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
 
Pass: WG1egElCvO

 
We just list the directory where we are currently present and saw that there is a .trash folder and then navigate inside that. Then we saw that there is an executable names as bin then we just tried to run that

 
Here we got some binaries and then we just tried to convert then to ASCII to see if that has some meaning

 

And it is the password for the next level 0dyxT7F4QD

Level 5:-
ssh leviathan5@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
 
Pass: 0dyxT7F4QD

 
Then we see the contents of the present directory and found out that there is an executable file named leviathan5 the we tried to run that and also used ltarce tool and found out that it is reading the contents of the file /tmp/file.log so we just created a symbolic link to file.log file 

 
Then we run the program and got the password for that. The password is szo7HDB88w
 
Level6:-

ssh leviathan6@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
 
Pass:szo7HDB88w

 
We just list the directory in which we are present and found that there is an executable file named leviathan6 and we tried to run that program and it is taking 4 digit number as the password so we just need to make a simple bruteforce program.

 
Just made a temp file in the targeted system and named the program that i made as brute.sh
#!/bin/bash
for a in {0000..9999}
do
echo”Trying password: $a”
~/leviathan6 $a
done
 
 
After gaining the shell we just triedd the id command and we have the privilege of the leviathan7
And in the cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan7 we got the password
 
The pass id qEs5Io5yM8
 
Level7:-

ssh leviathan7@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223
 
We just listed the files in the current directory and we have the congratulation message there .
